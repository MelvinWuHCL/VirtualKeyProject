# DESCRIPTION

## Project objective: 

As a Full Stack Developer, complete the features of the application by planning the development in terms of sprints and then push the source code to the GitHub repository. As this is a prototyped application, the user interaction will be via a command line. 

 

## Background of the problem statement:

Company Lockers Pvt. Ltd. hired you as a Full Stack Developer. They aim to digitize their products and chose LockedMe.com as their first project to start with. You’re asked to develop a prototype of the application. The prototype of the application will be then presented to the relevant stakeholders for the budget approval. Your manager has set up a meeting where you’re asked to present the following in the next 15 working days (3 weeks): 

 * Specification document - Product’s capabilities, appearance, and user interactions

 * Number and duration of sprints required 

 * Setting up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype 

 * Java concepts being used in the project 

 * Data Structures where sorting and searching techniques are used. 

 * Generic features and three operations: 

    * Retrieving the file names in an ascending order

    *  Business-level operations:

       * Option to add a user specified file to the application

       * Option to delete a user specified file from the application

       * Option to search a user specified file from the application

       * Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context

    * Option to close the application

 

The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible. 
 

### The flow and features of the application:

 * Plan more than two sprints to complete the application

 * Document the flow of the application and prepare a flow chart 

 * List the core concepts and algorithms being used to complete this application

 * Code to display the welcome screen. It should display:

    * Application name and the developer details 

    * The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information 
   
    * Features to accept the user input to select one of the options listed 

 * The first option should return the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be either empty or contain few files or folders in it

  * The second option should return the details of the user interface such as options displaying the following:

 * Add a file to the existing directory list

 * You can ignore the case sensitivity of the file names 

 * Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list

 * You can add the case sensitivity on the file name in order to ensure that the right file is deleted from the directory list

 * Return a message if FNF (File not found)

 * Search a user specified file from the main directory

 * You can add the case sensitivity on the file name to retrieve the correct file

 * Display the result upon successful operation

 * Display the result upon unsuccessful operation

 * Option to navigate back to the main context

 * There should be a third option to close the application

 * Implement the appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance 


 

You must use the following:

 * Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application 

 * Java: A programming language to develop the prototype 

 * Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub 

 * GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions 

 * Scrum: An efficient agile framework to deliver the product incrementally 

 * Search and Sort techniques: Data structures used for the project 

 * Specification document: Any open-source document or Google Docs 


 

Following requirements should be met:

 * The source code should be pushed to your GitHub repository. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in it.

 * The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in your document. 

 * Document the step-by-step process starting from sprint planning to the product release. 

 * Application should not close, exit, or throw an exception if the user specifies an invalid input.

 * You need to submit the final specification document which includes: 

    * Project and developer details 

    * Sprints planned and the tasks achieved in them 

    * Algorithms and flowcharts of the application 

    * Core concepts used in the project 

    * Links to the GitHub repository to verify the project completion 

    * Your conclusion on enhancing the application and defining the USPs (Unique Selling Points)
